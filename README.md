## 👋 Hi there, I’m a developer growing Beyond the Code

👨‍💻 As a Python-loving backend developer 🐍,  
I want to use technology 🔧 to contribute to making people's lives better 🌍.

My goal is to solve complex issues 📊 through data and technology,  
and to create socially meaningful value 🌱.

I believe great software isn’t just about writing working code —  
it’s about understanding the system, solving real problems,  
and building something meaningful.

🛠 From programmer to engineer  
📚 Learning deeply, thinking systemically  
🌱 Growing one line at a time — beyond the syntax

> **Beyond the Code. Because the real story lies beyond the syntax.**
